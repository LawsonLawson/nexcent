# NexcentLanding Page (Clone)

This is a simple **landing page project** built with **HTML and CSS** to
practice front-end development skills. It is inspired by the design of
the **Nexcent website** and serves as a hands-on exercise to strengthen
my skills in layout building, CSS Grid/Flexbox, responsive design, and
clean code structuring.
